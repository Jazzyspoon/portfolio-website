# portfolio-website
This is my first portfolio website I made during my Career Foundry bootcamp. It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap 4.
I decided not to use this site for my professional website (www.jasonpottorffportfolio.com), as it doesn't currently meet all of my needs.
That said, I will continue to tweak this over time and maybe create a template out of it eventually.
